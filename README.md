Dominoes is a family of games played with rectangular tiles. Each tile is divided into two square ends. Each end is marked with a number (one to
six) of spots or is blank. There are 28 tiles, one for each combination of spots and blanks (see image).
Write a program which allows two players to play Dominoes against each other:
- The 28 tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock. Each player draws seven tiles.

- Pick a random tile to start the line of play.

- The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends;

- A tile may only be placed next to another tile, if their respective values on the
connecting ends are identical.

- If a player is unable to place a valid tile, they must keep on pulling tiles from the stock
until they can.

- The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile.

- You're not supposed to create an interactive application. Just write a program that will
follow the rules above.
Try to create the program without the use of frameworks.
